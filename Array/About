This repo contains the codes of the array related segment
Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements that have a contiguous memory location.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. 
We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0 index.

IN JAVA THE ARRAY IS USED FOR THE SPECIFIED REASONS
Advantages

    Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
    Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

Disadvantages

    Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

Types of Array in java

There are two types of array supported by jvm. These are
Single Dimensional Array
Multidimensional Array
