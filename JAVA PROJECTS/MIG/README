This is my first java project.
In this project I have tried to include all mig or any other fighter jet related dependencies and classes (Pilot and Co-Pilot)

Here JAVA's basic features like OOP's are used in addition with some advacned features like Java AWT ( for Buttons, Images, Frames,
PAnel etc.)

The basic Idea was for any jet to fly several steps are taken:
  - Initially several checks are performed
  - Then several pilot and co-pilot dependencies are included
    
  PILOT
    - Pilot has basic flight and flight feature
    - In flight and fight several diffrent functionalities are there like aim, distance, ammunition type etc. These are included
  
  CO-PILOT
    - Co-pilot has it's own functionalities like Communication
    - Own missiles panel
    
All the files uploaded are interlinked to each other and severs diffrent functionality hence all are required to be cloned or 
downloaded to ensure proper usage. Apart from this the images also have to be downloaded and a proper url must be inserted to
ensure their functioning as well.
