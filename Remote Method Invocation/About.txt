ABOUT

Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is an API which allows an object to invoke a method on an object that exists in another address 
space, which could be on the same machine or on a remote machine. Through RMI, object running in a JVM present on a computer 
(Client side) can invoke methods on an object present in another JVM (Server side). RMI creates a public remote server object 
that enables client and server side communications through simple method calls on the server object.

Working of RMI:-
The communication between client and server is handled by using two intermediate objects: Stub object (on client side) and 
Skeleton object (on server side).

Stub Object:-
The stub object on the client machine builds an information block and sends this information to the server. The block consists 
of
    An identifier of the remote object to be used
    Method name which is to be invoked
    Parameters to the remote JVM

Skeleton Object:-
The skeleton object passes the request from the stub object to the remote object. It performs following tasks

    It calls the desired method on the real object present on the server.
    It forwards the parameters received from the stub object to the method.
