JAVA Programs and Learn Java
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere! 

   ## The JVM Environment-
   A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a local machine or system to run Java programs which are on compliation time changed to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.
   
   ## WHY JAVA??
  Java is a multipurpose language with one of the largest user dependency and use cases. In today's market 60% tools are build in java and is one of the highly decorated language shared among people.
  
   ###  - OOP's
   In Java everything is a classs. The java coding itself has a main constituent of a class. It is one of the greatest supporter of OOP's Ideology. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.
   
   ### - Platform Independent
   Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.
   
   ### - Simple
   Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.
   
   ### - Vast Library
   Java has a very vast library and hosts practially every need for a programmer to code in any environment.
